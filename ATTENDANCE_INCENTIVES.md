// Considers last attendance date
```

**Rules:**
- Must attend within last 14 days to maintain streak
- Consecutive weeks count toward streak
- 1-week gap allowed (same week attendance)
- Resets after 2+ weeks absence

### **Longest Streak:**
- Tracks all-time best streak
- Never resets
- Historical record

---

## Perfect Attendance Calculation

### **Perfect Month:**
- All services in any calendar month
- Minimum 4 services required
- Checks each month independently

### **Perfect Quarter:**
- All services in 3 consecutive months
- Currently simplified (future enhancement)

### **Perfect Year:**
- All services in any calendar year
- Minimum 40 services required
- 100% attendance rate
