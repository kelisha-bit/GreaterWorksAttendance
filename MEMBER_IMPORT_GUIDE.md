## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### "Gender must be Male or Female"
- **Cause:** Gender field has invalid value
- **Solution:** Use exactly "Male" or "Female" (case-sensitive)

#### "Phone number already exists"
- **Cause:** Phone number is duplicate
- **Solution:** Check for duplicates in your file and database

#### "Full Name is required"
- **Cause:** Name field is empty
- **Solution:** Fill in the name for that row

#### "Department is required"
- **Cause:** Department field is empty
- **Solution:** Select a valid department

#### "Error reading file"
- **Cause:** File format issue
- **Solution:** Ensure file is saved as CSV, not Excel format

### File Format Issues

**Problem:** Excel adds extra formatting
**Solution:** 
1. Open CSV in Notepad to verify format
2. Ensure commas separate fields
3. Quotes around fields with commas

**Problem:** Special characters cause issues
**Solution:**
1. Use UTF-8 encoding
2. Avoid special characters in names
3. Use standard ASCII characters
