## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can we keep the web app and add a mobile app?
**A:** Yes! The web app and mobile app can coexist. They share the same Firebase backend.

### Q: How much will it cost to maintain?
**A:** Minimal ongoing costs: $99/year for Apple, $25 one-time for Google, and Firebase usage (likely free or <$50/month).

### Q: How long until we can launch?
**A:** MVP in 4-6 weeks, full launch in 12-16 weeks depending on features and resources.

### Q: Do we need separate teams for iOS and Android?
**A:** No! React Native allows one team to build both apps simultaneously.

### Q: What about updates?
**A:** Updates require app store approval (1-7 days for iOS, hours for Android). Critical fixes can use over-the-air updates.

### Q: Can users still use the web version?
**A:** Yes! The web app remains fully functional. Users can choose their preferred platform.

### Q: What if we want to start small?
**A:** Start with a PWA enhancement (add to home screen, offline mode) before committing to native apps.
