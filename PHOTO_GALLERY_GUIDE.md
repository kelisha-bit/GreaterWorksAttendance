## Best Practices

### Photo Upload Guidelines

1. **Image Quality**
   - Use high-quality photos (but under 10MB)
   - Ensure good lighting and focus
   - Crop or edit before uploading if needed

2. **Naming Convention**
   - Use descriptive titles: "Easter Sunday Service 2024" not "IMG_1234"
   - Include the event name and date
   - Be consistent with naming

3. **Categorization**
   - Choose the most appropriate category
   - Use "Other" only when no category fits
   - Consider creating new categories if needed frequently

4. **Metadata**
   - Always add a description for context
   - Include the event date for historical records
   - Add location for events outside the main church
   - Use relevant tags for better searchability

5. **Privacy Considerations**
   - Get consent before uploading photos of individuals
   - Be mindful of children's photos
   - Avoid uploading sensitive or private moments

### Organization Tips

1. **Regular Uploads**
   - Upload photos shortly after events
   - Don't let photos accumulate
   - Keep the gallery current

2. **Consistent Tagging**
   - Use standard tags across similar events
   - Include year in tags: "2024", "easter2024"
   - Add people's names when appropriate

3. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Upload the best photos, not all photos
   - Remove duplicates or similar shots
   - Aim for 10-20 photos per event

4. **Maintenance**
   - Periodically review old photos
   - Remove outdated or irrelevant photos
   - Update descriptions if needed
