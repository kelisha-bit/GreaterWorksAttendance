# Event Calendar Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Issue: Saved Events Not Showing

### Quick Fixes

#### 1. Check Browser Console (F12)
Open the browser console and look for:
- Number of events fetched
- Date range being queried
- Any error messages

**Expected Output:**
```
Fetched events: X events
Date range: [start date] to [end date]
Events: [array of events]
```

#### 2. Verify Event Date
**Problem:** Event might be outside the current view's date range

**Solution:**
- If you created an event for December but viewing October, it won't show
- Navigate to the correct month/week/day
- Or switch to **Agenda View** which shows next 30 days

**Steps:**
1. Click the "Today" button to go to current date
2. Use Previous/Next arrows to navigate to event date
3. Or switch to Agenda view to see all upcoming events

#### 3. Check Event Visibility
**Problem:** Event visibility might be set to "Private"

**Solution:**
- Private events only visible to admins/leaders
- Log in as admin or leader to see private events
- Or change event visibility to "Public" or "Members Only"

**Check in Firebase Console:**
1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Open `events` collection
3. Find your event
4. Check `visibility` field (should be "public", "members", or "private")
5. Check `status` field (should be "published", not "draft")

#### 4. Check Event Status
**Problem:** Event might be saved as "Draft"

**Solution:**
- Draft events only visible to admins/leaders
- Change status to "Published" to make visible to all

#### 5. Refresh the Page
**Simple Fix:**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- This clears cache and reloads everything

#### 6. Check User Role
**Problem:** User might not have permission to view certain events

**Solution:**
- Verify user role in Firebase Console
- Go to `users` collection ‚Üí find user ‚Üí check `role` field
- Should be: "member", "leader", or "admin"

## üîß Detailed Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Press `F12` or right-click ‚Üí Inspect
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Refresh the Events Calendar page
4. Look for console logs

### Step 2: Check Console Output

**Good Output (Events Found):**
```
Fetched events: 5 events
Date range: Mon Oct 01 2024 to Wed Oct 31 2024
Events: [{id: "abc123", title: "Sunday Service", ...}, ...]
```

**Bad Output (No Events):**
```
Fetched events: 0 events
Date range: Mon Oct 01 2024 to Wed Oct 31 2024
Events: []
```

### Step 3: Diagnose the Issue

#### If "Fetched events: 0 events"

**Possible Causes:**
1. No events in that date range
2. Event date is outside current view
3. Firestore security rules blocking access
4. Event visibility/status preventing access

**Solutions:**

**A. Check Date Range**
- Look at the date range in console
- Is your event's date within this range?
- Navigate to the correct month/week

**B. Check Firestore Console**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: `gwccapp-fc67c`
3. Go to Firestore Database
4. Check `events` collection
5. Verify events exist

**C. Check Event Data**
Click on an event document and verify:
```javascript
{
  title: "Sunday Service",
  startDate: Timestamp (Oct 20, 2024 09:00:00),
  endDate: Timestamp (Oct 20, 2024 11:00:00),
  visibility: "public",  // ‚Üê Should be "public" or "members"
  status: "published",   // ‚Üê Should be "published"
  eventType: "worship_service",
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### If "FirebaseError" in Console

**Error: Missing or insufficient permissions**
- Security rules not deployed
- User not authenticated
- User role not set

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Error: Invalid query**
- Date format issue
- Missing required fields

**Solution:**
- Check that event has `startDate` field as Timestamp
- Re-create the event if necessary

## üéØ Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "I just created an event but can't see it"

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Is the event date within the current view?
- [ ] Is the event status "Published" (not "Draft")?
- [ ] Is the event visibility "Public" or "Members Only"?
- [ ] Did you refresh the page?
- [ ] Are you viewing the correct month/week/day?

**Quick Fix:**
1. Click "Today" button
2. Switch to "Agenda" view
3. Look for your event in the list
4. If not there, check Firestore Console

### Scenario 2: "Events show in Firestore but not in calendar"

**Possible Causes:**
- Security rules issue
- Date format issue
- Query range issue

**Debug Steps:**
1. Open browser console
2. Check for errors
3. Look at "Fetched events" count
4. Verify date range matches event date

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Check event date format in Firestore
// Should be: Timestamp, not String
startDate: October 20, 2024 at 9:00:00 AM UTC+0
// NOT: "2024-10-20"
```

### Scenario 3: "Some events show, others don't"

**Likely Cause:** Visibility or status differences

**Check:**
1. Events with `visibility: "private"` ‚Üí Only admins/leaders see
2. Events with `status: "draft"` ‚Üí Only admins/leaders see
3. Events with `visibility: "public"` ‚Üí Everyone sees

**Solution:**
- Edit events to change visibility to "public"
- Change status to "published"

### Scenario 4: "Events disappeared after changing month"

**This is Normal!** Events are filtered by date range.

**Solution:**
- Navigate to the month where events exist
- Use Previous/Next buttons
- Or use Agenda view to see all upcoming events
