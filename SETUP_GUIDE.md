## Step 10: Create Sample Data (Optional)

3. Add documents with these fields:
   - `name`: "Choir", `createdAt`: [timestamp]
   - `name`: "Ushering", `createdAt`: [timestamp]

### Add Sample Members

Use the app's "Add Member" feature to create sample members, or add directly to Firestore:

2. Auto-generate document ID
3. Add fields:
   ```
   memberId: "GW123456789"
   fullName: "John Doe"
   gender: "Male"
   phoneNumber: "+233123456789"
   email: "john@example.com"
   department: "Choir"
   membershipType: "Adult"
   createdAt: [timestamp]
   updatedAt: [timestamp]
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase: Error (auth/configuration-not-found)"
**Solution**: Make sure you've enabled Email/Password authentication in Firebase Console

### Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions"
**Solution**: Check that you've deployed the Firestore security rules correctly

### Issue: "Storage: User does not have permission"
**Solution**: Check that you've deployed the Storage security rules correctly

### Issue: Can't create admin user document
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Firestore Rules
2. Temporarily change to test mode:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Create the admin user document
4. Restore the production rules from `firestore.rules`

## Security Checklist

Before going live, ensure:

- [ ] Firestore security rules are deployed
- [ ] Storage security rules are deployed
- [ ] Admin user is created with strong password
- [ ] Firebase API keys are not exposed in public repositories
- [ ] Email/Password authentication is enabled

## Next Steps
